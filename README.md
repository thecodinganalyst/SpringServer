# SpringServer Sample

This is just a demonstration to create a simple [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) server using Spring, compiled with Maven and run with Spring boot.

This project will set up a http server on default port 8080, serving a simple Movie database in [HATEOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)

The database is using H2, running in memory. 

http://localhost:8080/movies
